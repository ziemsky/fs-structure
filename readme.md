# fs-structure
A Java library whose goal is to make it easy to declare, create and retrieve elaborate structures of files and
directories on and from a local file system.

The original purpose of the library was to aid in tests verifying code whose responsibility is to find or
otherwise manipulate file system items but there is nothing preventing from using this library to easily
manipulate such structures in production.
  
## What
Defines a fluent API that exposes convenient factory method allowing to define structures in an intuitive, declarative
way. For example, code:
```$java
import static com.ziemsky.fsstructure.FsStructure.*

...

Path testDir;

FsStructure fsStructure =
        create(
                file('topLevelFile'),

                dir('topLevelDir.empty'),

                dir('topLevelDir.withContent',
                        dir('nestedDir.empty'),
                        dir('nestedDir.withContent',
                                file('nestedFile.level2'),
                        ),
                        file('nestedFile.level1'),
                )
        ).saveIn(testDir)
... 

```
...creates the following tree of files and folders under the path given by `testDir`:
```
├── topLevelDir.empty/
├── topLevelDir.withContent/
│   ├── nestedDir.empty/
│   ├── nestedDir.withContent/
│   │   └── nestedFile.level2
│   └── nestedFile.level1
└── topLevelFile

```

## Why
To make interactions with file system structures easier by using more intuitive language than `java.nio.file.Path`
and `java.io.File`.
